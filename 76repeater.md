## History:
At the site of Georgia's **first 2-meter repeater**, the 76 Repeater was replaced several years ago with a Kenwood commercial-grade repeater paired to a SCOM 7330 controller. The receive antenna is approximately 100 feet up the Channel 8 TV transmission tower. The transmit antenna is under the pyramid roof on top of the public observation building.
