# Patâ€™s Antenna Weight
Some means of strain relief is needed when hanging a dipole between trees as the trees 
will move with the wind.

One method is to tie a rope to one end of the dipole, run the rope through a pulley and 
attach other end of rope to a weight.
## Materials
* Stainless steel eye bolt with nut
* Ready Mix Concrete
* Large oatmeal box or other form. 

## Directions:
1. Mix the concrete with as little water as feasible.
> Too much water in the concrete mix will soak into the oatmeal cardboard rendering it a soggy mess with poor outcome.
2. Fill the oatmeal box form with the concrete. Place the eye bolt with nut in center of concrete so that the eye is just above top of concrete. Let set until concrete hardens and then remove the oatmeal box.

You will now have an antenna weight that will out last the antenna system and can be passed on.
