## History:
The AMRC 220 Repeater was originally put on the air in 1992 for use by novice operators that did not have priviledges on the 2M band. The original site was at Memorial Drive at I-285 with the antenna mounted at about 70 ft. On April 21, 2002 the repeater was moved to a new home in Exchange Park at the DeKalb County Public Safety tower location. The antenna was mounted at the 325ft level on that tower. In February of 2015 the repeater was moved to the top of Stone Mountain as a temporary location while repairs were made to the antenna system at Exchange Park. As of April 7, 2016, the 220 repeater is back in service at Exchange Park.
