# Exam Preparation

There are a few prerequisites you must obtain before taking the license exam.  Of course, adequate preparation by studying relevent sections of the [ARRL Handbook](http://www.arrl.org/shop/search.php?mode=search&by_title=Y&by_descr=Y&by_sku=Y&search_in_subcategories=Y&including=all&substring=ARRL+handbook) as well as the [license-specific manuals](https://www.arrl.org/shop/search.php?mode=search&by_title=Y&by_descr=Y&by_sku=Y&search_in_subcategories=Y&including=all&substring=ARRL+License+Manual) will help.

## FCC Registration
Once you have studied or otherwise prepared yourself to pass the test, you will then need a ULS number.
<br><br>
*ULS stands for "United License System" which is a database managed by the FCC.*
<br><br>
The ULS number is used to associate assigned callsigns to individuals in the ULS system.
