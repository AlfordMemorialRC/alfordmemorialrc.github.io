## History:
We purchased the repeater, new, from a Motorola dealer and ham (K1DMR) in N. Georgia. The duplexer was purchased from a fellow ham (W4MO) in Florida via eBay. The duplexer was several years old and required a thorough cleaning and tuning to our new frequency. This service was provided by Duplexer Repair Service in Opelika Alabama also operated by a fellow ham (KK4ICE).
